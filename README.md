## Weather Dashboard

This *Weather Dashboard* allows users to search for current and future weather conditions in a city of their choosing! This application retrieves weather data for cities around the world using a third-party API, "OpenWeather One Call API" and runs within the browser while featuring dynamically updated HTML and CSS.  

# Description
When this application is loaded, user arrives to the WEATHER DASHBOARD landing page. The user is able to input a city name into the search box located on the left, and click on the search (magnifying glass) button. The application stores this search entry in a blue box located beneath the search box on the left. On the right side of the page, the city name, today's date and current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index). In addition to this, a five day weather forecast for the respective city is also produced. User can search for a new city in each entry and the data will reflect the current and projected weather conditions for the selected city. These new search entries are added to the top of a growing list underneath the search box. Users are also able to click on previous search entries to load the weather conditions for previously searched cities. If a user would like to clear the page, they can simply hit refresh button located to the left of the URL box.
